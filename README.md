## 🌍 Domains I Worked With

I’ve built applications for:

- **Civil & Hydrology Engineers** for developing flood and dam-break emergency plans by building hybrid simulation software that models flood-wave propagation, evaluates risk to people and estimates evacuation times—enabling more reliable, data-driven decision-making for emergency planners.
- **Hydrology Engineers** for managing complex river basins by creating real-time optimization and forecasting tools that compute optimal water distribution, prevent flooding, improve drought resilience and maximize hydropower generation.
- **Mechanical Engineers** for detecting defects in furnace coils, pipelines and industrial plant infrastructure using ultrasound and 3D imaging thus improving safety and reducing downtime in critical energy systems.
- **Medical Researchers** for detecting pneumonia, classifying its type, extracting lesions and quantifying disease severity—providing faster for more accurate insights for both clinical and research applications.
- **Cartographers & Geospatial Analysts** for improving OpenStreetMap and interactive mapping tools, including editing-history viewers for moderators, custom map rendering, geospatial data processing and enhancing developer / user workflows, thus improving usability, efficiency and and data accuracy.

## 🛠️ Core Expertise

I specialize in designing and implementing end-to-end solutions using numerical methods, high-performance computing and large-scale data visualization. By combining strong **computer science** and **mathematical** foundations with production-grade engineering, I cover the full workflow from data acquisition to visualization and reporting:

### 1️⃣ Data Acquisition
Robust real-time data ingestion over Ethernet and USB.

### 2️⃣ Data Processing
Implementation of advanced computational and analytical techniques, including:

- Signal processing and time-series analysis
- Numerical modeling and statistical analysis
- Parallel and distributed computing using OpenMP, MPI and CUDA
- Machine learning and deep learning using TensorFlow and Keras
- Mathematical optimization (linear, integer and non-linear programming)

All processing pipelines are implemented in C (from 99 to 23), C++ (from 98 to 23) and Python, depending on performance requirements.

### 3️⃣ Rendering & Visualization
High-performance 2D / 3D visualization:

- Scientific visualization with VTK, ParaView, OpenSceneGraph
- Real-time rendering with OpenGL, Vulkan, WebGL and WebGPU
- Custom visualization pipelines for large geometries, simulations and volumetric data

### 4️⃣ Reporting
Automated generation of interactive or static engineering reports using:

- Python scripting pipelines with matplotlib and plotly for 2D / 3D charts
- 3D-enabled PDF generation (embedded interactive models using U3D / PRC)
- Microsoft InterOp for Word/Excel report automation
- Web dashboards and HTML-based data visualizations

Focused on delivering actionable insights for engineering teams, field operators and decision makers.
